Hey everyone, welcome to my new website and blog! It looks like my old site got taken down because I hadn’t touched it in a while, so I’m trying something new with GitHub Pages and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

So far, the experience has been pretty refreshing. I’m a big fan of Markdown, and using it to write blog posts and web pages just feels right. Let’s see where this goes—hopefully, I can keep this site updated regularly.

I’ve got some ideas I’m excited to try out, especially around some architecture utility projects. I’m thinking about doing a few explainers and maybe even starting a POC or demo. Stay tuned!
