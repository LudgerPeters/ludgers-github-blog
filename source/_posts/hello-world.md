Welcome to my new Website and Blog, looks like my last website was taken down/lost due to inactivity. Going to try something new here using Github Pages and [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

So far the experience has been refreshing, I am a big fan of mark down and using it to write blog posts and web pages has always made sense to me. Let us see where this goes and hope I can keep this website updated regularly. 

I do have some ideas I plan try specifically around some architecture utility projects I would like to explain and maybe start a POC/demo.
